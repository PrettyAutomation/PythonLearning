### Arithmetic operator
```
a= 20; b= 30
print a+b # Addition = 50
print b-a #Subtraction = 10
print a*b #Multiple = 600
print b/a # Divide = 1
print b%a # Remainder = 10
print b**a # Exponential = 348678440100000000000000000000
print b//a # (Floor division)floor value of the quotient produced by dividing=1
```
### Comparison operator
```
print a==b # False
print a!=b # True
print a<=b # True
print a>=b # FALSE
print a<>b # True (If the value of two operands is not equal, it is true.)
print a<b  #True
print a>b  #False
```
### assignment operators
```
print a += b  #it will give syntax invalid error
a -= 20
print a # Ans=0
a *= 2
a %= b
a **= 2
a //= b
a &= b
a ^= b
a |= b
a >>= b  #(shift digits from right side)
a <<= b  #(shift digits from Left side)
```
### Logical operators
```
print a>b and b<a
print a>b or b<a
print not (a>b)
```
### Identity operators (Use to compare 2 objects)
```
print a is b      #False
print a is not b  #True
```
### Membership Operators
```
a = [10, 20, 30]
print 10 in a      #True
print 50 not in a  #True
```
### Bitwise operators
```
& 	 AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|	  OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^	  XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~ 	 NOT	Inverts all the bits
<<	 Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>>	 Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
```
